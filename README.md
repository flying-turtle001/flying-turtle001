# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is Justin and I am passionate about web development. 

Starting with smaller WordPress projects, I wanted to develop steadily and have now found my way to Jamstack. In this context I was able to gain first experiences with JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Vue.js and React.js. I was particularly excited about working with Nuxt.js and Gatsby.js. Other topics like Headless CMS or general developments in HTML, CSS and JavaScript also arouse my interest.

With my solutions I want to help companies to grow.
